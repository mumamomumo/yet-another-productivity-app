A project that I used to learn Typescript and React. This was made for a school project. 

You can change it if you want, but don't ask me about the code, I don't know how it works either.

I didn't use AI to make this, which is why it's not that good. I tried adding comments to make it more readable, I don't think it helped much

I wonder how many 'anti-patterns' there are in this project.
