## Yet another productivity app
as if we didn't have enough of those.

This was made for a school project, and was also an opportunity for me to learn Typescript with ReactJS. I used TailwindCSS, and Tauri to create a desktop app. I used zustand as the store. No AI was used for this app, as you may be able to tell from the horribly written code. 

If my code is understandable, feel free to edit the code. Otherwise, don't ask me, I don't understand it either.
